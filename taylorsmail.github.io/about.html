            <h2>About</h2>
            <h3>I am a Senior at the University of Oklahoma, triple majoring in accounting, economics, and management information systems. In high school, I achieved the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America. I have continued to be very involved in on-campus activities in college, striving to improve the world around me. I am currently serving as Co-Director of Associate Development for the JC Penney Leadership Program in OU's Price College of Business, helping associates to improve on business and leadership skills. I am also currently serving as the social chair for Beta Alpha Psi which is the professional accounting fraternity on campus. I believe that my education and my experiences on and off campus will make me a valuable asset to your company.</h3>
